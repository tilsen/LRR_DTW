The contents of this directory contain all of the code 
necessary to conduct the analyses and generate figures of the manuscript:

Tilsen & Tiede (under review) Looking within events:
examining internal temporal structure with local relative rate.

REQUIREMENTS:

1) The code in this repository requires the toolbox https://github.com/tilsen/DTWm.git
	
2) The function tw_helpers.m must be edited to specify paths to the input data.

3) Input data is available from an OSF repository:
	https://osf.io/3m6kb/?view_only=577cb04cf536472eb65b10b80bbe21db

GET STARTED:

1) download DTWm-main.zip and LRR_DTW-main.zip (this repository) from https://github.com/tilsen

2) extract DTWm-main.zip and LRR_DTW-main.zip into a folder

in Matlab:

3) set the working directory to the folder where you extracted the repositories

4) execute addpath(genpath(pwd))

5) if running on other than Windows, cd into DTWm-main and run mex dtwm_costmatrix.c

6) Run the livescript ./examples/local_relative_rate.mlx, or the script 
	./examples/local_relative_rate_script.m,
   to see how local relative rate is calculated.
   
7) The script tw_worklow.m conducts all of the processing steps. Various functions for
	data processing are located in the subdirectory ./processing, and additional helper
	functions are in ./helpers

8) The script tw_figures.m generates all of the figures in the manuscript. 
	The functions for generating each figure are in the subdirectory ./figure_code
